                            megacity of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an
                            imam of a
                            original synagogue . At the same time, his mama , Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four
                            sisters and
                            one family in his family, from which he was the youthful. Kalam's ancestors were fat dealers

                            had come shy and plodded hard to make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to vend journals
                            to condense
